# Project S.C.A.L.E.



  # Description

  Project S.C.A.L.E. aka S.C.A.L.E. Up! aka by the Heroku URL as Ambitions S.C.A.L.E. Up!
  
  A MERN Full-Stack application deployed on Heroku. Spent less than two weeks to build a minimum viable product that takes the idea of a budgeting app and mashes it with concepts from the author of 'Atomic Habits' James Clear regarding identity-based habits and the idea of daily 1% gains adding up. (Disclaimer: I have not read any of his books.)  

  S.C.A.L.E. is an acronym I made which stands for Small Changes Accumulate Large Effects. The web app allows you to select an ambition and each day that you spend working on your ambitions you can record them on the app and track your progress with line charts and some stats.  

  Besides MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), other techonologies used for the web app include GraphQL as the API for CRUD operations, Redux Toolkit to handle state management, Chart.js (and its React package) to handle generating charts, Tabler Icons React for the free icons used in the buttons and Mantine which is a component library which is responsible for making this project my first foray into TypeScript and how to not use it properly (All types are any).
